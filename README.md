# RSA-Implementation
Implementation of RSA key exchange using modular exponentiation and OAEP padding

the public and private key are outputted before taking input. 

message m on line 237 is what gets encrypted. This takes input as a string, 
outputs its OAEP padding, RSA encryption,
and outputs what is gotten after the message is decrypted - which should be what is inputed 
to begin with.
